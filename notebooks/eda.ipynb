    "The idea for this project came after reading a 2024 PwC report highlighting the immense scale of global financial fraud, which results in trillions of dollars in losses annually. With the growing usage of instant payment systems like Pix and Zelle, as well as the rapid expansion of e-commerce, fraud incidents are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. Traditional rule-based systems often fall short in identifying modern fraud patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivated me to explore how modern Machine Learning techniques can be applied to build a robust, modular, and explainable pipeline for fraud detection. The focus is on practical implementation, reproducibility, and the application of best practices in MLOps.\n",

    "\n",

    "The dataset was released as part of the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition and sourced from real-world e-commerce transactions provided by Vesta Corporation. It features over 590,000 transactions (about 3.5% labeled as fraudulent), each described by **431 features**—including 31 categorical and 400 numerical features—along with a relative timestamp and a binary fraud label :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.\n",
