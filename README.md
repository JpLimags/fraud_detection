# Fraud Detection 💳



## 🎯 Objective & Motivation
According to a 2024 report by PwC, financial fraud causes trillions of dollars in global losses annually, and the frequency of digital payment fraud continues to rise with the increase in e-commerce and instant payments like Pix or Zelle. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to detect sophisticated, fast-evolving fraud patterns, leading to the need for intelligent, adaptive solutions. Machine Learning offers a powerful approach to analyzing large volumes of transaction data in real time, detecting subtle anomalies that could indicate fraud.

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline that accurately detects fraudulent transactions, while also providing model explainability and seamless deployment. It demonstrates a real-world use case that could be integrated by banks, fintechs, and payment platforms to reduce financial risk and improve digital security.

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- MLflow, DVC, Optuna for tracking and tuning
- SHAP for model explainability
- Streamlit or Gradio for interactive UI
- Docker, GitHub Actions for containerization and CI/CD
